How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

  Wireframing with pair was harder than doing it alone because it's hard to describe with words what to do in a picture. But having to talk through everything did clarify some things along the way (like if we had to actually include text, etc.). Creating the HTML page wasn't as hard because of sublime's autocomplete feature (less room for error) and also because it was a very basic html page.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

  Wireframing is helpful because it's the first step to deciding what you want to include. We started at that point and then discussed if we needed certain things and we got rid of a few others.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

  We decided that a good wireframe is basic. We found ourselves trying to complicate it, but stopped ourselves a few times. We also thought it should still be inclusive, though, so that all of the basic information for the site is present.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?

  I learned about the aside element. When we were going to input the side searchbar and side info (recent articles), we had this page open - http://html5doctor.com/downloads/h5d-sectioning-flowchart.png - and decided an aside would be appropriate for those parts.
