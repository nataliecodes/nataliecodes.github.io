What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

  I officially now remember that padding is between content and the border. I also learned that Chrome has some built-in padding that may or may not have to be taken out when formatting.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

  I learned that it's still annoying. And also that I should copy and paste my class IDs because I thought that I was using the positions and displays incorrectly, but I really just didn't type in anything properly.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

  It was easiest to change the colors and fonts and sizes. It was most difficult to position everything. I had two boxes that I couldn't use regular auto spacing for because they had different amounts of text in them and it looked off when I spaced them out.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

  I learned that it's hard to come up with the proper classes. I think I probably could have broken out some of my styling further, but I was spending too much time working on this. I also learned the value of DevTools. It's really easy to see your changes happen in real time.
