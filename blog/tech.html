      <h1 class="normal-text">How computers work</h1>

      <h2 class="normal-text">A very basic primer about how computers work so that we can better understand coding.<h2>

      <h2 class="normal-text">November 22, 2015</h2>

      <p class="normal-text right-text-margin">The first thing I always say about computers is that they are not magic. They cannot do anything that humans cannot do. They're a super efficient way of doing human things, but they're still not magic.</p>

      <p class="normal-text right-text-margin">The thing that makes computers easy to use is their interfaces. Although behind the scenes there are really a bunch of ugly-looking commands going on, computers have progressed to have interfaces that can take a user's input and translate it into something the computer will understand. For example, if I open up the command line and just write "Print the document I have open," nothing will happen. But, if I go to File then Print, the computer understands what I want and will print the document for me.</p>

      <p class="normal-text right-text-margin">There is one basic thing that computers need to do: store and represent information. Information is stored in binary code, and can be represented in many other different ways.</p>

      <p class="normal-text right-text-margin">Computers use binary code to store information. Everything behind your computer is written in a bunch of 1s and 0s. These 0s and 1s make up bits, and bits make up bytes. This is how all information is stored in your computer! Watch the video below ("How Computers Work video") in order to learn more about binary code.</p>

      <p class="normal-text right-text-margin">In order to control the flow of the millions of actions your computer takes, there are three logical steps a computer has - and, or, and not. These steps are extremely simple. This shows that everything you do in a computer can be broken down to these flow control steps.</p>

      <p class="normal-text right-text-margin">When you have an 'and' option as the gate between one step and another, in order for your desired output to occur, two conditions (your two inputs) must also be true/'on.' The 'or' condition is similar, except just one of the two inputs needs to be true/'on.' The 'not' condition is simpler; the output is simply the opposite of the input.</p>

      <p class="normal-text right-text-margin">These three control flow options in your computer are the same as the control flow options in programming languages. If you begin to think about computers as one big domino chain of these much smaller steps, then you will begin to see how our complex machines work as a compilation of millions of tiny steps.</p>
