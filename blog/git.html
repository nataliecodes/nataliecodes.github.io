      If you're confused about git, Github and version control, don't worry: I'm hoping to help explain it to you in this blog post.
    </p>

    <p>
      I only started my Dev Bootcamp program a week ago, so I've only been coding for a week. Be that as it may, I have already learned cool things about the world of "coding."

      The first major concepts we covered have to do with the aforementioned git and GitHub. I used to think they were the same thing; they're not! Git is a version control system that allows you to track the history of your files. GitHub is a website that allows you to collaborate on projects (that use git). So: GitHub is a website that was created in order to allow programmers -- who use git -- to share and edit their code with others.
    </p>
    <p>
      It makes a lot of sense for programmers to use version control. Git is just one type of version control -- just like how Kleenex is actually just one brand of tissue. Version control, more generally, is vital for programmers who want to edit a file simultaneously. By using GitHub, an entire team can submit their changes to a file in an organized way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Version control is key to good programming. Not only does it allow for tracking of code, it also allows for easier collaboration on projects.

      Thanks for reading my first post! It's weird to think that when I look back on this post in a few weeks, I will have learned so much more.
