      <h2 class="normal-text">My first blog post as a Dev Bootcamp student<h2>

      <h2 class="normal-text">October 5, 2015</h2>

      <p class="normal-text">If you're confused about git, Github and version control, don't worry: I'm hoping to help explain it to you in this blog post.</p>

      <p class="normal-text">I only started my Dev Bootcamp program a week ago, so I've only been coding for a week. Be that as it may, I have already learned cool things about the world of "coding."</p>

      <p class="normal-text">The first major concepts we covered have to do with the aforementioned git and GitHub. I used to think they were the same thing; they're not! Git is a version control system that allows you to track the history of your files. GitHub is a website that allows you to collaborate on projects (that use git). So: GitHub is a website that was created in order to allow programmers -- who use git -- to share and edit their code with others.</p>

      <p class="normal-text">It makes a lot of sense for programmers to use version control. Git is just one type of version control -- just like how Kleenex is actually just one brand of tissue. Version control, more generally, is vital for programmers who want to edit a file simultaneously. By using GitHub, an entire team can submit their changes to a file in an organized way.</p>

      <p class="normal-text">Version control is key to good programming. Not only does it allow for tracking of code, it also allows for easier collaboration on projects.</p>

      <p class="normal-text">Thanks for reading my first post! It's weird to think that when I look back on this post in a few weeks, I will have learned so much more.</p>
